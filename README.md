# CampusCache

## Description

Creating a geocaching app that focuses on campus exploration can be a great way to encourage people to get out and explore their surroundings. CampusCache helps users find caches by pinging phone notifications about hints of where to find the cache. This may include more straightforward clues or quite cryptic hints based on the difficulty scale. As well as the ability to create your own cache and create hints for it. 

We used Firebase as a backend and React Native as a framework. While in the build process, we experienced challenges like learning new skills that we didnâ€™t have before, such as the React Native framework. Linking each page to page was proving to be challenging at first, however, after some time debugging, we worked it out and created a seamless nav-bar. Trying to implement a location service into the project to bring up more hints the closer you get to the cache is a challenge. 

## Future

For the future of the app, we are considering a full-scale app launch based on interest and feasibility, as well as accounts letting you edit and delete the caches you have made. Based on the amount of caches you have found, you will have the ability to earn a badge.
